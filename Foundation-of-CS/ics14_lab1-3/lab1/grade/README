This directory contains autograding scripts for the CS:APP Data Lab.

NOTE: Before running the autograding scripts, make sure that the datalab/src
directory has already been built: 

    unix> cd datalab/src
    unix> make

1. Files
********

grade-datalab.pl
	The Data Lab's autograder. Grades a single bits.c handin 
	file and emits a report on standard output.

grade-handins.pl
	A driver that invokes the autograder on every handin
	file in the handin directory.

config.pm
	Config file for grade-handins.pl and grade-datalab.pl

handin/
	The handin directory containing the student's programs

printdir.pl
	A handy script that calls enscript on each file in a directory.

Each script takes a -h argument that describes its command line
arguments.

2. Configuring the autograding scripts
######################################

The config.pm file contains all of the configuration info for the
grading scripts. It defines defaults that can be overridden on the
command lines, as well as the distribution of correctness,
performance, and style points.

*********************************************
3. How to use the grade-datalab.pl autograder
*********************************************

Collect all of the student bits.c handin files in the ./handin
directory.  To grade a single handin file (say
./handin/droh-bits.c) type:

    unix> ./grade-datalab.pl -f handin/droh-bits.c

Use the -e flag if you don't want the student's handin file included
in the output grade sheet.

If you have a small class, you can run grade-datalab.pl manually on
each handin file. If you have a bigger class, you'll want to use the
grade-handins.pl program, which will invoke grade-datalab.pl on each
handin file automatically.

NOTE: The autograder assumes that the datalab/src has been built. If
the autograder fails, a likely reason is that you cleaned the src
directory without rebuilding it. Here's the fix:

    unix> cd datalab/src
    unix> make

*****************************************
4. How to use the grade-handins.pl driver
*****************************************

To grade all of the handin files in the ./handin directory, type:

    unix> ./grade-handins.pl

This calls the grade-datalab.pl autograder for each handin file in
directory handin, and redirects the resulting grade sheets to files
in the handin.grades directory. 

Use the -e flag if you don't want the student's handin file included
in the output grade sheet.

You can expect that some handins will have problems, either because
their code won't compile, or their program dumps core. In these cases,
the driver flags the problem, and goes on to the next handin file.

You can print compact hardcopies of the grade reports using enscript:

    unix> enscript -P<your printer> -2r ./handin.grades/*.out

If you have two-sided printers and want to start each student's
submission on a new page, you can use the printdir.pl script.
